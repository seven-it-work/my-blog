Q：You said you're not a computer science major. Why did you choose to work in the computer industry?
你说你不是计算机专业，那你为什么选择从事计算机行业呢？

First, I've been interested in computers since I was a kid. I remember using commands to crack passwords on my family's computers at a young age. Then in college, I was forced to switch to my current major because of the Chinese adjustment. But it didn't quench my thirst for coding. So in college, I taught myself python, java back in the work of the school will be the front-end related technology system.
Second, I love to code and I love to automate. Coding automation makes my work and life more efficient. I like the saying, hands free to enjoy life.
第一，我从小就对计算机感兴趣，记得在很小的时候我就利用命令对家里的计算机进行密码破解。然后在读大学的时候，因为中国的调剂我被迫调到了目前的专业。但是并没有浇灭我对编码的渴望。于是在大学期间我自学了python、java后面在工作中学会了前端相关技术体系
第二点，我喜欢编码、并且喜欢自动化，编码自动化能提高我工作和生活的效率。我很喜欢一句话，解放双手享受生活
